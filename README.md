## Overview

The job listing page is a responsive web application built using React, HTML, and CSS. It showcases a collection of job listings using demo data, providing users with a simulated experience of browsing and searching for job opportunities.

The page is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive layout. Each job listing is presented with key details such as job title, company name, location, and application deadline. Users can easily navigate through the job listings and explore different options.

Although the page utilizes demo data instead of integrating with real-time job listing APIs, the development process still allowed me to gain valuable experience in structuring and presenting information effectively. I focused on creating a smooth user interface and implementing features like filtering and sorting to enhance the browsing experience within the limitations of the demo data.

By building this job listing page, I learned the importance of designing intuitive user interfaces, organizing data in a meaningful way, and providing users with tools to refine their search. These skills can be further applied to future projects that involve integrating with real APIs and delivering dynamic and personalized content to users.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories
